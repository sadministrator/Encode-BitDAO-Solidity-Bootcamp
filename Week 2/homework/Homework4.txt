Homework 4
1a. The best data structure to hold an association between a user address and their balance (and most types of similar associations) is a mapping.
2a. One way to allow the balance variable to be read from the contract is through the implementation of a getter function. The other way is using the getter function that is automatically created by the Solidity compiler when you declare a public variable.
4a. We don't need the sender's address as a function parameter because it is already automatically included as the 'sender' attribute of the global 'msg' object.
4b. The implication would be increased gas costs because the the extra data we are sending.
